# Symphony of the Stars: Harmonizing the James Webb Space Telescope in Music and Images

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/) by the **Cosmic Mozart** team. The challenge we tackled is ["Symphony of the Stars: Harmonizing the James Webb Space Telescope in Music and Images"](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/symphony-of-the-stars-harmonizing-the-james-webb-space-telescope-in-music-and-images/). Our web application integrates stunning visuals from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with harmonious sounds, creating a unique and immersive experience that connects the cosmos to music.

## Features

- Visualize incredible images from the James Webb Space Telescope
- Generate soundscapes based on cosmic data
- Explore the relationship between stars, galaxies, and harmonics

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python-based web framework
- **Python**: Backend logic
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend
- **NASA API**: For obtaining data from the James Webb Space Telescope
